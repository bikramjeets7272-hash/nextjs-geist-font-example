# Plan for "The Skill Tree" Advertisement App

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a modern, responsive advertisement app for a computer institute named "The Skill Tree." The app features a landing page with a hero section, course overview, testimonials, and a contact form. The design emphasizes clean typography, spacious layouts, and intuitive user interactions without relying on external icon libraries or images.

## File Changes and New Components

1. **New Page: Advertisement Landing Page**
   - **File:** `src/app/skill-tree/page.tsx`
   - **Purpose:** Serve as the main landing page for the advertisement, composing all new sections.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Import and integrate the new components.
     - Use semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., `<section>`) for clear structure.
     - Ensure proper error boundaries and fallback behaviors if any section fails.

2. **New Component: SkillTreeHero**
   - **File:** `src/components/SkillTreeHero.tsx`
   - **Description:** A hero section featuring a prominent headline, tagline, a call-to-action button, and a representative hero image.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Headline text: "The Skill Tree" with a tagline like "Cultivating Future Tech Leaders."
     - A call-to-action button (using the existing UI button from `src/components/ui/button.tsx`).
     - An `<img>` element with `src` set to  
       ```
       "https://placehold.co/1920x800?text=Modern+professional+advertisement+for+The+Skill+Tree+computer+institute"
       ```
       - Includes detailed `alt` text and an `onerror` handler for fallback.
   - **Error Handling:** Fallback to a local asset or a plain colored background if the image fails to load.

3. **New Component: CourseOverview**
   - **File:** `src/components/CourseOverview.tsx`
   - **Description:** Displays an overview of courses offered by the institute.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Use a static array of course data (e.g., course title and short description).
     - Render each course inside a card using the existing Card component from `src/components/ui/card.tsx`.
     - Layout as a responsive grid for various screen sizes.

4. **New Component: Testimonials**
   - **File:** `src/components/Testimonials.tsx`
   - **Description:** Showcases testimonials from students.
   - **Key Features:**
     - List out 2â€“3 testimonials using simple, clean typography and spacing.
     - Use plain `<div>` or card layouts to present the student name and review text.
     - Ensure alignment and readability with ample white space.

5. **New Component: ContactForm**
   - **File:** `src/components/ContactForm.tsx`
   - **Description:** Provides a simple form for user inquiries.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Include controlled form inputs for Name, Email, and Message.
     - Implement basic client-side validation with clear error messages.
     - Utilize the existing Button component for submission.
     - Maintain error handling to prevent form submission with empty or invalid fields.

6. **Global CSS Updates**
   - **File:** `src/app/globals.css`
   - **Changes:**
     - Add new CSS classes (e.g., `.hero`, `.section`, `.form-group`) to support the advertisement layout.
     - Ensure consistency in typography, colors, spacing, and responsive design.

7. **README.md**
   - **File:** `README.md`
   - **Updates:**
     - Document the new route (`/skill-tree`) and describe the functionality of each new component.
     - Include instructions on running the Next.js development server and testing the new advertisement page.

## Integration Details and Best Practices

- **Component Composition:**  
  The landing page (`page.tsx` under `skill-tree`) imports and sequentially lays out the four new components. Each section is wrapped in a `<section>` element with relevant CSS classes to enforce spacing and design consistency.

- **UI/UX Considerations:**  
  The UI employs modern typography and a clean layout. The hero section uses a bold headline and high-quality placeholder image, while the course overview and testimonial sections adopt grid and card layouts for readability. The contact form emphasizes clear input fields with visible error messages to enhance user experience.

- **Error Handling:**  
  For images, the `onerror` attribute ensures that if the external image fails to load, a fallback strategy is in place (e.g., a local asset or a default colored area). Form validations prevent submission with missing or invalid fields.

- **Component Reusability:**  
  Existing UI components (e.g., button, card) are reused to maintain consistency with the project's design and reduce code duplication.

- **Future Scalability:**  
  The components are structured to allow for easy updates, such as integrating dynamic data from an API for courses or testimonials if needed later.

## Summary
- A new advertisement landing page for "The Skill Tree" is implemented in `src/app/skill-tree/page.tsx`.  
- Four new components (SkillTreeHero, CourseOverview, Testimonials, and ContactForm) are created to modularize the UI.  
- Global CSS (`src/app/globals.css`) is updated with new styling rules.  
- Error handling includes image fallback mechanisms and form validation with user feedback.  
- The design employs modern typography, responsive grid layouts, and clear call-to-action elements.  
- README.md is updated with development and usage instructions to guide future maintenance and enhancements.
